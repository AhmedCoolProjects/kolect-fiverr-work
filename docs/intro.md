> LooksRare is the community-first NFT marketplace that actively rewards traders, collectors and creators for participating.

## 🖼👌 By NFT people, for NFT people

This is who we are.

Part of being community-first means that LooksRare rewards, empowers, and gives back to the platform's users and creators.

- **💎 Get rewarded** \- Users that buy or sell any NFTs on LooksRare earn LOOKS tokens.
- **🤝 Share the platform fees** \- 100% of trading fees are earned by LOOKS stakers.
- **⚡️ Creators get paid instantly** \- Creators get royalty payments at the moment of sale.

## 🍴 Not a fork

LooksRare’s smart contracts are custom-built within a modular system that enables new features to be rolled out over time – without compromising security – thanks to standardized signatures that clearly define the execution scope.

This means we can offer new types of interactions, like these (rolling out soon):

- **Collection offer** \- Make an offer that covers all NFTs in a selected collection
- **Trait offer** \- Offer to buy any NFT with a specific trait in a collection e.g. BAYC w/ Gold Fur
- **Multi-cancellation** \- Cancels multiple open orders in one transaction

## 🦖 Not a dinosaur

From utilizing some of the world’s most powerful search infra, down to implementing on-chain standards like EIP-712 and ERC-2981, LooksRare’s technical architecture (contracts, database, API, front end, search) has been designed from the floor up for **scalability, speed and security** using the latest and greatest tech.

We’ve also made sure to retain compatibility for deploying on ETH scaling solutions when they're ready for the masses.
